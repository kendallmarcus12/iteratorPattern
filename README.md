# iteratorPattern
Those finicky chefsâ€¦ Now, they want the Diner Menus shown random order but ensures that every item is shown.

Write a RandomDinerMenuIterator class, and use it instead of the DinerMenuIterator. Change the DinerMenu class so that it uses your new iterator and make sure it runs correctly. To make implementation simpler, assume adding and removing items during the process of iterating through the RandomDinerMenuIterator is NOT allowed.
